			<p>Art Start connects New York City's artists and creatively-minded professionals with marginalized children and youth to make masterpieces. In 23 years, Art Start's nationally recognized model of arts-education has been powered over <a href="url">1,100 volunteer artists</a> in NYC.</p>

			<p>Volunteering for Art Start is more then just community service — it's life enhancing for all involved. Paired up with young people whose dreams far surpass their immediate circumstances, artwork is just one of the magical results. Your ideas, your time, your expertise and your willingness to make a relationship with a child or a teen, even if just for one night a week, will open up their minds to seeking opportunity and plowing towards their goals — not to mention how it will open you up as an artist and creative mind.</p>

		<h2 class="col-2">Become an Industry Partner</h2>
		<p>Partnering with New York City's arts, media and business industries is vital to Art Start's mission to provide our youth with new experiences. We also rely on the industry to help fund Art Start's programs and spread awareness about our work.</p>

		<p>Over the years, Art Start has partnered with major retailers such as H&M, Lord & Taylor, Saks Fifth Avenue, among others. We've been supported by brands such as Bulgari, Alexander Wang, Charlotte Olympia, Replay Jeans, House of Horology, and so many more. </p>

		<p>Production companies, record labels, art galleries, law firms, advertising agencies, even the New York Stock Exchange, all have partnered with Art Start to support our work in ways that fit into the culture of their company.</p>

		<p>Some partners get involved with the Art Start youth as mentors, internship hosts or by providing workshops on various aspects of their industry specialty. Other partners don't engage the youth but support the Art Start programs that engage them by partnering for industry events, sales and promotions, or other creative collaborations that spread awareness and gather support for Art Start. </p>

		<p>If you would like to explore an industry partnership with Art Start, contact Art Start's Executive Director <strong><a href="url">Johanna@art-start.org</a></strong></p>
