		<h2>Homeless Youth Outreach</h2>
<div class="container-one-column">
	<div class="single-column" id="#">
		<p>Through partnerships with numerous city-run and non-profit shelters, Art Start conducts creative arts workshops five days a week with homeless youth ages 5-18. From bucket drumming, building a 20- foot Chinese dragon, writing a song, choreographing a dance, painting a self-portrait or playing in a band, Art Start recognizes the obstacles keeping these youth from seeking out extracurricular outlets for their creative energy.  Art Start brings our youth a unique formula that's fluid and adaptive, yet focused and consistent.</p>
		<p>Workshops are led by Art Start staff and a team of committed volunteers and focus on building trusting relationships with the youth.  Art Start creates a safe and creative space inside the workshops while connecting them to new experiences outside the shelter.</p>
		<p>Art Start's Homeless Youth Outreach Program is made possible by the Lily Auchincloss Foundation, Variety the Children's Charity of New York, and the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York State Legislature.</p>

	<h2>Emerging Artists-in-residence</h2>
	<p>A generation of young New Yorkers are being sidelined. 1 in 5 New Yorkers between the ages of 17-24 are out of school and out of work. The consequences are an increased risk for low academic achievement, unemployment and crime. Art Start is answering the call with The Emerging Artists-in-Residence Program (EAR) is a six-month residency for NYC youth emerging artists between the ages of 17-20 that have exhibited exceptional artistic talent but lack the resources and support to turn these talents into opportunities for their future. The EAR program provides residents with a rigorous schedule of coursework, project creation, networking, paid internships, showcase opportunities, two-year planning, a transportation stipend and career-counseling in the creative professional industries. Residents go on to use their creative talents and professionalism to become art students, performers, and above all, responsible young adults with a clear vision and a plan for their personal success.</p>
	<p>Art Start is currently working with three two young residents for the June-December, 2014 session and continues to engage our alumni residents on multiple projects.</p>
	<p><strong>Apply to the EAR Program</strong></p>
	<p>Art Start accepts applications year-round, on a rolling basis. Candidates cannot be attending high school or college during the prospective program dates. Candidates are required to fill out an application, submit samples or ideas of work, letters of recommendation, and have guardian approval to be considered for an interview. <strong>Candidates <em>must</em> be available to dedicate up to 24 hours per week to the program for the full six months.</strong></p>

	<h2>Youth Offender Outreach</h2>
	<p>Through partnerships with New York City alternative sentencing programs,  Art Start provides music, visual, and performing arts programs to youth with open court cases. During this crucial window of time, participants are able to commit to goal-oriented creative projects, express themselves, hone in on their goals, and re-direct their energy toward positive goals.  Art Start  believes that by honoring these young people and their voices, we discover the key to opening greater opportunities with them.</p>
	<p><strong>ONE MIC</strong> is intended to awaken self-realization in teens that have been mandated to alternative to incarceration programs in NYC. The program uses Hip Hop pedagogy, an instructional method that utilizes hip hop culture to provide a bridge to concepts that promote critical understanding, via the Bruce Willis/Art Start Recording Studio. Through year-round, student-centered workshops, participants cultivate original works while learning to think critically about their roles in the world around them. Media production techniques, event coordination, social networking and leadership development are among the strengths they attain.</p>
	<p>Existing through partnerships with NYC alternative sentencing programs, <strong>ONE MIC COLLECTIVE (OMC)</strong> is a group of young adult artists who have committed to creating and performing music to spread awareness about issues that affect their lives and communities. OMC's mentors provide the participants with nurturing artist development, while holding them accountable for responsibility, professionalism and discipline throughout the creative process. Workshops, recording sessions and live performances are among the spaces where OMC participants find opportunities to grow artistically and personally.</p>
	<p><strong>GRAFFITI IS...</strong> is a summertime visual arts workshop created to guide teens with their personal messages and visual creation. With local community artists mentoring and guiding the participants and heavy personal development principles such as responsibility, integrity and identity threaded through this workshop, teens find out what they stand for and against. Whether it's designing a mural, clothing or graphic design piece, they make their messages heard by all, creatively and <em>legally</em>.</p>

	<h2>2014 Portrait Project</h2>

	<!--  Carousel  -->
	<div><img class="centered" src="#"><cite>- Art Start youth portrait for The Portrait Project. Photo by David Johnson</cite></div>
	<p><a href="url">Art Start's 2014 Portrait Project</a> has connected with homeless, foster, formerly incarcerated, and otherwise marginalized NYC teens to develop an exciting and empowering glimpse into their dreams. Through visual art and creative writing workshops, in-depth video interviews, professional photo shoots and elaborate composite imaging, youth first imagined their selves without barriers then saw their selves living it, in a large-format photographic print. With photography, wardrobe, hair and make up, prop styling, set design and composite retouching, a photographic tableau has been created for each youth so they can experience the power and permanence of seeing themselves at the highest expression of themselves. Art Start believes that <a href="url">this process</a> of defining, envisioning, and actually seeing their images can profoundly transform youth––their confidence, their optimism, their direction and the way they interact with the world.</p>
