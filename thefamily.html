		<div class="left-family">
		  <p><strong>Johanna De Los Santos</strong> has been the Executive Director of Art Start since July of 2007. Prior to joining the Art Start family, she spent years revolutionizing the indie film industry's release platform by pioneering the "Social Outreach Campaign" for two major motion picture film releases, Favela Rising (2005) and The Hip Hop Project (2007), taking conscious, independent film on nationwide tours through under-served communities, homeless shelters and juvenile detention facilities as a part of their distributor's traditional release campaign. From 2003-2005, Johanna served as Manager of Community Partnerships for the New York International Latino Film Festival and holds three years of corporate business planning expertise from the multinational Briggs & Stratton Corporation. Johanna received a B.A. from the University of Wisconsin (1998) and a M.A. from New York University in Latin American Studies (2007) where she focused on art and music as a social movement in communities oppressed by systemic violence. In 2010, Johanna was awarded "Non-Profiteer of the Year" by the New York Association of Non-Profit Professionals. Johanna's pride lies in her journey from an at-risk teen to the woman she is today, in large part due to her parents who relentlessly inundated her with music, sewing, art, Shakespeare, and most importantly, the unconditional creative freedom to express herself - a gift she hopes to pass on to her own children.</p>
